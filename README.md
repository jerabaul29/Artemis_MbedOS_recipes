# Artemis_MbedOS_recipes

A few recipes / tests for the Sparkfun Artemis boards using MbedOS.

I am using the Artemis Arduino core with Mbed-OS backend: https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Apollo3 .

I am programming from Ubuntu 20.04.

My board for testing sketches is a RedBoard Artemis: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15444 .
