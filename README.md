# Artemis_MbedOS_recipes

A few recipes / tests for the Sparkfun Artemis boards using MbedOS.

I am using the Artemis Arduino core with Mbed-OS backend: https://github.com/sparkfun/Arduino_Apollo3 . **NOTE**: the initial aim was to focus on the core v2, i.e. the MbedOS based core. However, it is not fully mature yet, so at the moment, most of the recipes are for the core v1.

I am programming from Ubuntu 20.04.

My board for testing sketches is a RedBoard Artemis: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15444 .
